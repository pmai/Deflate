Release 1.0.4
=============

 * Make dynamic huffman table decoding more robust against out of bounds
   distance entries, based on a PR from @se-mz.
 * Detect invalid distance codes 30/31, for symmetrical treatment of
   invalid length and distance codes.
 * Revamp gzip header decoding to allow for checking of optional FHCRC
   CRC16 header checksum when checksum checking is enabled.
 * Improve optimize declarations, especially for LispWorks performance.
 * Remove no longer needed muffle annotations for SBCL.
 * Remove non-endorsement clause from license, making it pure MIT.

Release 1.0.3
=============

 * Correct type declarations for LispWorks simple int32 vectors.

Release 1.0.2
=============

 * Adjust package name specifications to belatedly support ACL in its
   "modern-mode".

Release 1.0.1
=============

 * Renamed Deflate system from Deflate to deflate to support
   convenience references to system by symbol rather than string name.
   NOTE: This is an incompatible change from all prior releases, all
   references to "Deflate" in system definitions will have to be
   changed to "deflate" or :deflate or equivalents.

 * Preliminary support for ecl has been added:  Due to bugs in current
   versions of ecl (10.7.1), prior versions of Deflate do not work out
   of the box.  This version should work better, once fixnum-specialized
   arrays work again on 64bit versions of ecl in an upcoming release of
   ecl.
